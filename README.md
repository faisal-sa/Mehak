# Mehak — Real Estate Data Analysis & AI

Mehak is a Flutter-based data analysis and AI application that helps urban planners, investors, and business owners evaluate real estate and land parcels to determine the most suitable businesses to place at a location and to quantify the expected value contribution of a site.

Features
- Smart site suitability: AI models that recommend suitable business categories for a given parcel (e.g., retail, café, clinic, co-working).
- Value indicators: Numeric and visual indicators estimating potential value (footfall score, revenue potential index, visibility score, accessibility index).
- Interactive maps: Map-based UI to inspect parcels, surrounding points of interest (POI), and indicator overlays.
- Data fusion: Combines spatial data, POI, demographics, and local amenities for robust recommendations.
- Multi-language support: English and Arabic translations with RTL support.

Project structure (detailed)

The repository is a Flutter app organized by features and shared common code. Below is an expanded tree of the most relevant directories and a short description for each entry so contributors can find important functionality quickly.

Top-level
- `lib/main.dart` — App entry, app-level routing and initial bindings.
- `assets/` — Static assets (images, svg, fonts, translations).

Shared/common
- `lib/common/` — App-wide utilities, theming, context extensions and small reusable widgets.
  - `app_theme.dart` — Theme definitions (colors, text styles).
  - `context_extension.dart` — Shortcuts for BuildContext (padding, sizes, locale helpers).
  - `widget/` — Reusable UI widgets (generic form fields, input controls).

Feature modules
The codebase follows a feature-first layout under `lib/feature/`. Each feature generally contains `screen/`, `widget/`, and optional `controller/` folders.

- `lib/feature/boarding/`
  - `screen/boarding_screen.dart` — Onboarding flow screens and logic.
  - `widget/intro_card.dart` — UI card used in onboarding pages.

- `lib/feature/logo/`
  - `screen/splash_screen.dart` — Splash / logo animation entry screen.
  - `widget/` — Several small logo widgets and a `controller/` used for animation/timing.

- `lib/feature/login/`
  - `screen/login_screen.dart`, `screen/otp_screen.dart` — Login and OTP verification flows.
  - `widget/` — Reusable login widgets: text fields, phone/OTP inputs and buttons.

- `lib/feature/navigation/`
  - `screen/navigation_screen.dart` — Main navigation / shell for the app.
  - `controller/navigation_controller.dart` — Navigation state and tab management.

- `lib/feature/home/`
  - `screen/home_screen.dart` — Main map-based exploration UI.
  - `controller/estate_cards.dart`, `controller/overlay_control.dart` — Controllers for cards and overlay state.
  - `widget/custom_google_map.dart` — Map integration and overlays.
  - `widget/estate_card.dart`, `widget/estate_card_shimmer.dart` — Cards that show parcel/estate summaries and loading shimmer.
  - `widget/filter.dart`, `widget/search.dart` — Search and filter UI components.
  - `widget/scrollable_sheet.dart` — Bottom sheet used to surface details and card lists.

- `lib/feature/card_details/`
  - `screen/card_details_screen.dart` — Detailed view for a single parcel or listing.

- `lib/feature/chat/`
  - `screen/chat_screen.dart`, `screen/messages_screen.dart` — Chat UI and message list screens.
  - `widget/chat_app_bar.dart`, `widget/chat_container.dart`, `widget/message_card.dart` — Chat UI components.

- `lib/feature/favorite/`
  - `screen/favorite_screen.dart` — Saved / bookmarked parcels.
  - `widget/favorite_app_bar.dart` — Header for favorites screen.

- `lib/feature/account/`
  - `screen/account_screen.dart` — Account settings and profile UI.
  - `widget/account_app_bar.dart` — App bar for account screens.

Developer notes
- Tests: `test/` contains widget/unit tests (start with `flutter test`).
- Platform folders: `android/`, `ios/`, `web/`, `windows/`, `linux/`, `macos/` contain platform-specific build files and native glue.
- Build output: `build/` is generated by Flutter and should be ignored by commits.

Where to look for common tasks (quick links)
- Map & overlays: `lib/feature/home/widget/custom_google_map.dart`
- Estate cards & card logic: `lib/feature/home/widget/estate_card.dart`, `lib/feature/home/controller/estate_cards.dart`
- Onboarding & splash: `lib/feature/logo/screen/splash_screen.dart`, `lib/feature/boarding/screen/boarding_screen.dart`
- Auth & OTP: `lib/feature/login/screen/login_screen.dart`, `lib/feature/login/screen/otp_screen.dart`

This layout keeps UI, state, and small controllers collocated by feature which simplifies navigation and makes it easier to add or remove features without affecting unrelated code.

Quick start

Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK (stable)
- Android Studio / Xcode for platform builds

Install dependencies and run:

```powershell
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

Run tests:

```powershell
flutter test
```

AI & Data notes
- The app is a visualization and client layer. Heavy data processing, feature engineering, and model training are expected to run in backend services. The app consumes model outputs (suitability scores, recommended categories, and indicator explanations) via APIs.
- Suggested backend components:
  - Data ingestion (GIS, POI, census, footfall)
  - Feature engineering (buffers, density, accessibility)
  - Models (tree-based or lightweight neural nets)
  - API layer to serve parcel analyses

Design notes
- RTL and Arabic-first typography included via fonts in `assets/fonts`.

Where to look in code
- Map UI & overlays: `lib/feature/home/widget/custom_google_map.dart`
- Estate cards & controllers: `lib/feature/home/widget/estate_card.dart`, `lib/feature/home/controller/estate_cards.dart`
- Onboarding / Splash: `lib/feature/logo/screen/splash_screen.dart`, `lib/feature/boarding/screen/boarding_screen.dart`
- Login & OTP: `lib/feature/login/screen/login_screen.dart`, `lib/feature/login/screen/otp_screen.dart`

Contributing
- Fork the repo, add features or fixes, include tests, and open a Pull Request.
