# Mehak — Real Estate Data Analysis & AI

AI-powered real estate intelligence for urban planners, investors, and business owners.

Mehak is a Flutter-based data analysis and AI application designed to help users evaluate real estate parcels and determine optimal business placements. It intelligently quantifies the economic and spatial value of a location using data fusion and machine learning.

## Goal Features

- Value Indicators
  - Numeric and visual indicators estimating:
    - Footfall Score
    - Revenue Potential Index
    - Visibility Score
    - Accessibility Index

- Interactive Maps

## Project Structure Overview

The repository follows a feature-first architecture, keeping UI, logic, and controllers together for better scalability.

Top level
- `lib/main.dart` — App entry point
- `assets/` — Static assets (images, SVGs, fonts, translations)

Shared / Common Code (`lib/common/`)
- `app_theme.dart` — Theme definitions (colors, text styles)
- `context_extension.dart` — BuildContext shortcuts
- `widget/` — Reusable widgets (buttons, form fields, etc.)

Feature modules (`lib/feature/`)
Each feature has its own folder under `lib/feature/`, with subfolders for `screen/`, `widget/`, and optional `controller/`.
